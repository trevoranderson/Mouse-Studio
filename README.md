Jerry-Mouse
===========

To use:
Put the Mat Point and MouseMovement class files into your working directory. Instantiate a MouseMovement objecct.
The stuff generally does what it says on the box.

Project Status:
You are free to use/fork/pull-request. However, I still consider this project to be in early stages,
so function names and specification are likely to change.
